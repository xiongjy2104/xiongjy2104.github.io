As Ruby continues to march on, the maintainers have made the decision to
drop some previously-bundled gems. This release makes Jekyll depend
directly on those gems so that whether your Ruby installation has them
bundled or not, your experience can continue uninterrupted.

More details [are in the changelog]({% link _docs/history.md %}#v3-10-0).

Happy Jekylling!
